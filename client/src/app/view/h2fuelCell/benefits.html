                        <p>Carbon build-up leads to potentially expensive issues such as expensive failures of <strong>Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valves, Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF filters)</strong>, Turbo issues, inlet manifold and injector problems.</p>
                        <p>The H2 water fuel cell creates HHO molecules that pass through the air intake of an engine increasing the temperature of combustion and therefore stripping the built-up excess carbon that leads to poor running issues.</p>
                        <p>By removing harmful carbon build-up from your engine, you will experience both immediate and long term benefits, including. Cleaner engine and oils due to reduced hydrocarbon accumulation, which means <strong>fewer oil and filter changes.</strong></p>

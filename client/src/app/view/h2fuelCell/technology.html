                    <p>The <strong>HHO Cell </strong> uses electricity from the car’s battery to produce Hydrogen & Oxygen gas from water in the HHO Cell. This gas is then added to fuel air mixture of the car before it enters the engine. </p>
                    <p>In diesel and petrol engined vehicles as much as <strong>62.4%</strong> of the fuel is not converted to useful energy and is instead lost mainly as heat. By adding Hydrogen to the fuel air mixture a far cleaner burn of the fuel is achieved resulting in lower engine and exhaust gas operating temperatures.</p>
                    <p>When utilizing a hydrogen fuel cell far more of the fuel you pay for is converted into useful work to power the vehicle rather than being wasted as heat.</p>
                    <p>At the base level water is comprised of two atoms of Hydrogen and one atom of Oxygen or H2O, which makes it perfect as a fuel source. </p>
                    <p>Our unique H2 fuel cell system will separate a water molecule into its component atoms, this is achieved by using very little electricity and the subsequent gas is then <strong>injected into the engine and oxidized as fuel.</strong></p>
                    <p>The resulting energy is <strong>2.5 times more powerful than petrol/gasoline.</strong></p>
                    <p>This totally changes the combustion process and the by-product of the combustion is water vapor. As a fuel, water is powerful, cheap and pollution free. </p>
                    <p>The outcome of which is that the improvement in emissions and mpg far outweigh the energy required to produce the gas.</p>
                    <p>Of course you cannot fill your car with water yet, so for now we have to “split” water molecules into Hydrogen & Oxygen gas and use this to improve efficiency. </p>
                    <p>The H2 fuel cell aims to balance <strong>optimum performance with fuel economy.</strong></p>

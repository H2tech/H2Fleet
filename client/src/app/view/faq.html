                        <p>This is a fuel enhancement system and, because it’s semi-permanent, is not considered to be a permanent modification (it’s classed as no different to putting a high octane fuel in the tank).</p>
                        <p> Our system is classed as a NON- permanent fuel enhancement system, like the new ‘superfuels’.  </p>

                        <p> We do not modify the engine, only the fuel type. To date, we have not heard of any engine failures on vehicles running on Hydrogen as an alternative fuel.
                            For these reasons, it should not affect the customer’s insurance premium or vehicle warranty but they must inform their insurers/warranty companies or it may invalidate their insurance/warranty.  </p>

                        <p>   For DVLA purposes this system is classed as a dual fuel like LPG. We issue notes and ready-made letters to our customers for DVLA and the insurance and warranty companies.

                            <h2 class="section_header skincolored">? CAN YOU RUN THIS SYSTEM ON TAP WATER</h2>
                            <p>Yes but the impurities in tap water mean the fuel cell would not produce as much HHO gas as possible.
                                Bottled or distilled water is much better as it’s purer. 1 litre of water produces 1866 litres of gas! This means it does not need ‘topping up’ very often.
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="section_header skincolored">? WILL IT WORK ON MY VEHICLE</h2>
                            <p>Yes. It works with all fossil fuelled engines but works particularly well with diesels (& turbo diesels).
                                Vehicles with engine management systems may need some extra equipment and small modifications to work correctly.
                                However it will work on 99% of engines that use the internal combustion engine…even hybrids.
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="section_header skincolored">? HOW MUCH WATER DOES IT CONSUME</h2>
                            <p>Very small amounts. It’s difficult to give an exact amount as there are so many variables.
                                However, on average, the reservoir will need topping up every 300-500 miles only depending on what size
                                reservoir will fit under the bonnet. A two litre reservoir usually needs topping up every 1000 miles.

                            </p>
                            <h2 class="section_header skincolored">? DOES THIS SYSTEM WORK WITH OTHER FUELS</h2>
                            <p>Our fuel cells work with any type of fuel, Petrol, Diesel, Biodiesel, Vegetable Oil, Ethanol, E85, E10, and CNG.


                            </p>
                            <h2 class="section_header skincolored">? DO I NEED TO INFORM ANYONE ELSE BEFORE OR AFTER THE INSTALLATION</h2>
                            <p>Yes, your insurance company and warranty company if you have one, before installation.


                            </p>

                            <h2 class="section_header skincolored">? HOW MUCH WILL I SAVE</h2>
                            <p>This is a difficult one as each vehicle is different and each person drives differently.
                                You will see an improvement of between 15% and 70% (we have heard of certain vehicles in the US obtaining 250%,
                                obviously they only did a handful of miles to the gallon in the beginning and may be open to exaggeration!).
                                The average is 20 – 50% improvement in MPG. We try not to give over zealous claims so not to disappoint our customers.
                                Most people are extremely pleased with the results.

                            <h2 class="section_header skincolored">? HOW CAN HYDROGEN BE MORE EFFICIENT THAN JUST PETROL OR DIESEL</h2>
                            <p>Hydrogen is 13 times more powerful than petrol or diesel. It burns at a higher temperature and in a nutshell, this technology lowers
                                emissions and improves fuel mileage, thanks to a MORE COMPLETE COMBUSTION PROCESS. Petrol or diesel only releases 15%-25% of it’s
                                potential energy.  Instead of being converted to forward motion, it is instead converted to pollution/carbon deposits (unburned fuel),
                                as well as heat (global warming), vibration and noise.</p>
                             <p>
                                By introducing the HHO gas, approximately 70% of the available potential of the petrol or diesel is attained. The carbon vaporises at 3000
                                Celsius, resulting in a massive reduction in emissions and particulates.
                                There is also another reason why this gas works so well in an internal combustion engine. The Hydrogen, being the smallest particle in nature,
                                hits a droplet of fuel, cuts it into smaller droplets and attaches themselves to the smaller droplets. Now the finer, hydrogen-enhanced fuel mist is
                                capable of burning more thoroughly.

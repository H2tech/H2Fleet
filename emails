Vehicle classification and product type ..

Hi,

Not sure if you have this type of information floating about, but what would be handy is a spreadsheet that has vehicle classification against what the suitable product would be.

Now I am not sure what the classification property would be for vehicles …

You could use http://www.dft.gov.uk/vca/vehicletype/definition-of-vehicle-categories.asp or is there a more appropriate classification ..

… 

Either way I have added a blank spreadsheet to capture this information to the following folder ….

#   Technology

> Why does it improve effeciency

Far more of the fuel you pay for is converted into useful work to power the car rather than being wasted as heat.

> How it works ?

Water is comprised of two atoms of Hydrogen and one atom of Oxygen or H2O which makes it perfect as a fuel source. Our unique HHO system will separate a water molecule into its component atoms (H H & O or HHO). We can do this using very little electricity. This gas is then injected into the engine and oxidised as fuel. The resulting energy is 2.5 times more powerful than petrol/gasoline. This totally changes Combustion! The by-product of the combustion is water vapour. Therefore, as fuel, water is powerful, cheap and pollution free. The improvement in emissions and mpg far outweigh the energy required to produce the gas 

Of course you cannot fill your car with water yet, so for now we have to “split” water molecules into Hydrogen & Oxygen gas and use this to improve efficiency. Our hope is that our vehicle engines will try to balance optimum performance with fuel economy – the de Verde Hydrogen-on-Demand System will increase both, using the ‘trapped’ power of water which is released on-board-automatically as you drive! A single litre of distilled water can produce many thousands of litres of trapped gas, so you have to top it up from time to time. The final result is felt as you drive away and the smell of fuel from your exhaust disappears. Toxic exhaust gases NOx, HCs, CO are reduced to the point where they are almost undetectable – please see our 

> Materials

Originally designed by John Hickman and developed with Jason Munro, ten years’ of Hydrogen Cell R&D experience has resulted in a high-end product, built from marine-grade stainless steel and titanium, designed to be ahead of the game.

All the kits are high quality and clear running and will provide a solution to your emission issues, fuel economy and lack of performance with astounding results - ( wheres the astounding results )

#   Benefits in relation to product group - haulage

> Reduced CO - HO ::  Euro standards Age and make of vehicles and what their MOT readings got to,http://www.esos.uk.com/ http://www.sykes-pickavant.com/products/electrical-diagnostics-and-test-tools/emissions/1041

> Increased tourque display the rolling road data

> Engine health and maintenance Carbon build-up leads to potentially expensive issues such as Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valves, Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF filters), Turbo issues, inlet manifold and injector problems.
The system works by turning tap water into hydrogen molecules which pass through the air intake of an engine and out through the exhaust system, stripping the built-up excess carbon that leads to poor running issues.
By removing harmful carbon build-up from your engine, you will experience both immediate and long term benefits,
Cleaner engine and oils due to reduced hydrocarbon accumulation -Fewer oil and filter changes

H2 promise through a proof of concept
 > We appreciate that reveloutionary technology comes with a certain degree of uncertainty and that the normal course of the road is that ealry adopters pave the way for main stream adoption. We are so confident of the H2 fuell cell that we want to make a promise to you as a potential customer through a proof of concept that is of no cost to you the customer.
 
We make the following promise to you ::

1. An engineer from H2 haulage will visit you and install a indivdual H2 fuell cell on each vehcile you may have a use case for - free of charge
2. You will be able to run the fuel cell for 1 calendar month - providing enougth time for you to collect and analyse your own data.

After which we can discuss your requirements.

Money Back Gaurantee : Each Hydrogen fuel cell comes with a 30 day money back gaurantee - 

NOTE : When used in conjunction with the proof of concept this allows a full 60 days to access the H2 Fuel cell

Warranty

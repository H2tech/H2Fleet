> Why does it improve effeciency

Far more of the fuel you pay for is converted into useful work to power the car rather than being wasted as heat.

> How it works ?

Water is comprised of two atoms of Hydrogen and one atom of Oxygen or H2O which makes it perfect as a fuel source. Our unique HHO system will separate a water molecule into its component atoms (H H & O or HHO). We can do this using very little electricity. This gas is then injected into the engine and oxidised as fuel. The resulting energy is 2.5 times more powerful than petrol/gasoline. This totally changes Combustion! The by-product of the combustion is water vapour. Therefore, as fuel, water is powerful, cheap and pollution free. The improvement in emissions and mpg far outweigh the energy required to produce the gas 

Of course you cannot fill your car with water yet, so for now we have to “split” water molecules into Hydrogen & Oxygen gas and use this to improve efficiency. Our hope is that our vehicle engines will try to balance optimum performance with fuel economy – the de Verde Hydrogen-on-Demand System will increase both, using the ‘trapped’ power of water which is released on-board-automatically as you drive! A single litre of distilled water can produce many thousands of litres of trapped gas, so you have to top it up from time to time. The final result is felt as you drive away and the smell of fuel from your exhaust disappears. Toxic exhaust gases NOx, HCs, CO are reduced to the point where they are almost undetectable – please see our 

> Materials

Originally designed by John Hickman and developed with Jason Munro, ten years’ of Hydrogen Cell R&D experience has resulted in a high-end product, built from marine-grade stainless steel and titanium, designed to be ahead of the game.

All the kits are high quality and clear running and will provide a solution to your emission issues, fuel economy and lack of performance with astounding results - ( wheres the astounding results )

> Increased tourque

The bottom-end torque will increase to allow a smoother drive with a reduced need to change gears,resulting in increased mpg with less revs.

> Engine health and maintenance 

Carbon build-up leads to potentially expensive issues such as Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Valves, Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF filters), Turbo issues, inlet manifold and injector problems.
The system works by turning tap water into hydrogen molecules which pass through the air intake of an engine and out through the exhaust system, stripping the built-up excess carbon that leads to poor running issues.
By removing harmful carbon build-up from your engine, you will experience both immediate and long term benefits,
Cleaner engine and oils due to reduced hydrocarbon accumulation -Fewer oil and filter changes


#   H2 promise through a proof of concept

We appreciate that reveloutionary technology comes with a certain degree of uncertainty and that the normal course of the road is that ealry adopters pave the way for main stream adoption. We are so confident of the H2 fuell cell that we want to make a promise to you as a potential customer through a proof of concept that is of no cost to you the customer.
 
We make the following promise to you ::

1. An engineer from H2 haulage will visit you and install a indivdual H2 fuell cell on each vehcile you may have a use case for - free of charge
2. You will be able to run the fuel cell for 1 calendar month - providing enougth time for you to collect and analyse your own data.

After which we can discuss your requirements.

#   Money Back Gaurantee : Each Hydrogen fuel cell comes with a 30 day money back gaurantee - 

NOTE : When used in conjunction with the proof of concept this allows a full 60 days to access the H2 Fuel cell

#   Warranty

> Each H2 fuel cell come swith a 36-month Warranty with an option to extend*

It is an approved product with CE Certification and product liability insurance underwritten by Lloyds of London.

#  Installation

> CE marked product with full insurance

Fitted by the Manufacturer with CE Certification

de Verde Limited will be happy to supply and professionally install our system in your vehicle at our facilities in Paignton, Devon. Alternatively we have accredited installers in many areas around the country



#   Life cycle

> Installation

Our customers receive an Installation Certificate, Service Booklet and Maintenance Guide; and our system is installed by Trained, Qualified and Approved Installers as part of the product warranty, who are assessed and receive training certificates.


1. Cell installation

This hydrogen on demand system is fitted by the manufacturer and an installation certificate is provided to the customer.

2. Reuarly mainted by periodic topping up with distilled/filtered water.
3. de Verde electrolyte fluid should only be used. Use of any other product will void the warranty and may damage the cell.

> Instructions

1. In the event of the warning LED light on the cell switching off or appearing to fade; the customer should contact the technical helpline Tel: 01803 664701 or Email: info@hydrogenhybrids.uk.com.

2. Please pull out the main fuse from the smart relay before jump starting or attaching a battery charger across the battery. Failure to do this may cause damage and therefore void the Warranty.

3. It is recommended that you advise your insurers that you have a de Verde system fitted to your vehicle

#   FAQ

Does this affect my insurance

This hydrogen on demand system is designed to improve the efficiency of the engine to reduce emissionsto near zero and improve the mpg. It is an accessory, not a permanent fixture. It connects simply & can be easily removed.

It is not designed as a performance/race device.

It is not nitrous oxide.

It is an on-demand hydrogen system, which stores no gas on the vehicle.

It makes hydrogen on demand and burns when the engine is switched on.

When switched off there is no gas made or stored.

It is an approved product with CE Certification and product liability insurance underwritten by Lloyds of London.

Torque, emissions and efficiency will improve but not the power/bhp.
